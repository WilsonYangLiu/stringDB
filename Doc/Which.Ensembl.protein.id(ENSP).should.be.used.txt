Actually you need not go to any other site than string-db for obtaining the ENSP to 
Gene symbol mappings. Here's what you should do:

1. On the string download page, select the organism for which you want to download 
   the data and then look at the "General flatfiles & full database dumps" section. 
   You will see a "protein aliases" file link in the list, download that file.
2. Download that file. It contains species id, protein id (ENSP), alias (gene symbol 
   is found in this column) and source. In the source column, use sources like 
   BLAST_UniProt_GN, Ensembl_UniProt_GN or any source that you want to add in this 
   to obtain the lines that only map the ENSP to the gene symbols, since there are 
   many more identifier mappings in this file. Note that for each gene symbol, 
   there would be multiple transcripts (ENSPs) , hence multiple rows.
3. Once you get the curated mapping list, use the string "protein links" file to 
   obtain the network interaction data and simply replace the protein identifiers in 
   that file with their mapped gene symbols. Now you have the string data in terms 
   of gene symbols.
4. Create a network using your list of gene symbols.

Note: It seems that the string-db files are being updated to v10 currently. If the 
file is not available right now, do check after some time to get the updated data.
